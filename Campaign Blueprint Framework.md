# Campaign Blueprint Framework

*(for Persona Database + RAG Integration)*

Campaign blueprints are the **operating system of campaign design**—a repeatable framework that ensures every initiative follows a consistent process, produces usable assets, and generates insights that improve the next campaign.

They run through **4 phases**:

1. **Campaign Direction** – Ideation and strategy (job of the Campaign Strategist).
2. **Campaign Build** – Execution of the structure and assets (job of the Marketing Technicians).
3. **Campaign Optimization** – Continuous improvement and squeezing maximum results (joint effort of Analysts + Technicians).
4. **Business Intelligence** – Drawing intelligence from performance to refine future direction (job of the Analysts).

## **Blueprint → RAG Integration**

Each campaign blueprint becomes a **structured entry** in the RAG system, tagged by:

- Campaign Name
- Audience Segments
- Creative Angles
- Assets (ad copy, email copy, webinar invites, etc.)
- Performance Intelligence

This ensures the blueprint is both a **design artifact** and a **knowledge asset**—ready for future retrieval, remixing, or optimization.
